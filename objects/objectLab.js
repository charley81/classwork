// Objective: We are going to create an object Radio!

// How to begin:

// Create a variable called radio and assign as its value an object literal
// Give it a property called stations and make the value an array of station objects (at least 2)
// Give each station object a property called name and songs. Name should be a string and songs should be an array of song objects (at least 3).
// Song objects should have two properties: title and artist
// Create a method on your radio object that changes the station randomly (research Math.random and Math.floor)
// When the station is changed, pick a song from that station. Example: console.log("Now Playing:" + song.title + "by" + song.artist)

// Happy coding!
